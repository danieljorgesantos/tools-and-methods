2. Identify the Brand’s Alphabet
The visual language that designers will use should be based on the alphabet of a brand. The alphabet includes brand
 identity (brand and product values) and brand language (colors, fonts, shapes, animations, voice, and tone). 
 Define a brand’s identity, as well as its language, by reviewing the brand’s guidelines and interviewing stakeholders, then refer to this information when you work on design principles and style guides.

 4. Define Design Principles

5. Create Component/Pattern Library

It’s recommended to develop components that are not tied to a single-use case but can be reused in multiple contexts. To be reusable and scalable, components need to be the following:

Modular. Modular components are self-contained — they don’t have any dependencies. Modularity helps to create reusable and interchangeable components. 
Composable. It’s possible to create new components by combining existing components.
Customizable. It’s possible to adjust and extend components to make them work in a variety of contexts.

Accessibility
Accessible design enables users with diverse abilities to navigate, understand, and enjoy a UI.

Adaptive design
Adaptive layouts react to input from users, devices, and screen elements. Material guidance describes how to design for variable screen sizes, from phones and tablets, to desktop and beyond.

Design tokens
Tokens store style values like colors and fonts so the same values can be used across designs, code, tools, and platforms.

Interaction states
States are visual indicators used to communicate the status of a component or interactive element.
